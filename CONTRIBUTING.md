# Contribution

In order to contribute to the improvement of the project, below you will find the project development flow.
Before being able to open a PR with changes to be applied or bug fixes to be solved, it is necessary to open an issue 
and explain the reason and a possible solution. You can open each PR by forking the project and creating the PR directly from 
your project to the project of our library.

Main rules:
- Open issue
- Create PR from forked project
- Link your PR to the issue
